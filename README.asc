Hello!
I'm John Mayer's diary(TM) (C) (R)

== This one is good
[%hardbreaks]
It has *strong* significance to me.

If you give me just *one* night
You gonna see me in the _moonlight_

So i can see you in a *_New Light_*

`*_funky solo_*`

`aaaaaaaah` <- _sing with angelic voice_

**What do i do with all this?**

**L**ove is running through my **V**eins for _you_

== Another song idea?
[%hardbreak]
Noone really wins in ##Heart##break warfare

If you want more [.underline]#love#, why don't you ``say so``?

I don't care if we don't [.line-through]#sleep# at all tonight.
Let's just ^fix^ this ~poor~ thing now

=== Nice theme - reuse it every song
Why you wanna break my "`heart`" again
All we ever do is '`say goodbye`'

== Important stuff

If you really think about it, every node is like a friend to me ;)

TIP: This is my kind cluster configuration (so kind :p)
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: control-plane
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

.My friends list:
* control-plane (three of them)
* worker (also three of them)
* all my fans - *at least more than a thousand*
* Taylor Swift __(she friendzoned me ;<)__
